The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) hosts a [dataset][dataset] of all 1.3 million complaints it's received since its establishment in 2011.
I'm interested in determining the "worst" companies by sector.
The complete source code for all these visualizations can be found in the [CFPB repo][cfpb] on [my GitHub][github].

I generated two types of visualizations so far: Sankey diagrams and bar charts.
For the Sankey diagrams I used Google Charts for interactivity.

I started off by reading-in the data and finding the 10 most-complained-about companies by sector (called "Product" in the dataset).
I then generated bar charts by sector, shown below:
